<h1>Angella Curd</h1>
<p>My favorite activites would include fitness, watching my kids activities, and home remodeing. I wish that I had more time in the day because I have not had the opportunity to go to the gym or to workout at home for over a year now. It is something that motivates me. I love the changes that it makes to me physically.</p>
<p>I make sure that I do not miss any activity of my kids though. I love to see what they are doing and keep up with their lives. They are both extremely active in sports. Cheerleading, football, wrestling, and choir are all of the things that I can't imagine life without.</p>
<p>Lastly, I love to remodel or upgrade things in my house. I do most of the work myself. I just bought a house in July and remodeled every room upstairs in a week. This included laying laminate flooring through-out the entire first floor and gutting the kitchen to replace with new cabinets and appliances. I enjoy seeing the rewards of my work.</P>
